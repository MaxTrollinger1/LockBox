# LockBox

LockBox is a secure, peer-to-peer messaging application built in Python, featuring end-to-end encryption to protect private communications. It ensures users can exchange messages securely without relying on centralized servers.

## Features

- 🔒 **End-to-End Encryption** – Messages are encrypted using robust cryptographic methods.
- 🔗 **Peer-to-Peer Networking** – Direct communication without centralized servers.
- 🛡 **Secure Key Exchange** – Prevents interception of encryption keys.
- 💬 **Real-Time Messaging** – Instant message delivery between peers.
- 🏗 **Cross-Platform Support** – Works on various operating systems.
  
## Security Considerations and Roadmap

LockBox is in active development, with security being the top priority. The roadmap includes:

### 🔍 **Current Security Measures**
- **AES-256 Encryption** for message confidentiality.
- **RSA Key Exchange** for secure peer authentication.
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)** planned for future updates.

### 🚀 **Planned Enhancements**
- Implementing **secure multi-party communication**.
- Enhancing **metadata privacy** to prevent traffic analysis.
- Introducing **automatic key rotation** for added security.
- Conducting **third-party security audits** to ensure robustness.
